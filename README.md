# WalkSense: Accelerating Human Mobility Prediction

This project attempts to make a mobility prediction system, which
can predict whether a person is moving by means of transport or on
foot or not, by analyzing the GPS data of that person. The project was
done under the guidance of my mentors from UST Product
Engineering. The project can further be developed to make a fitness
tracking system. <br>

All the details of the project are in the **WalkSense Report** (pdf) file. <br>
